  <h1>STOCK MARKET</h1></center>
  <P><B>A stock market, equity market,</B> or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock">stocks</a> (also called shares), which represent 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership">ownership</a> claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange">stock exchange </a>as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies that are sold to 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor">investors</a>    through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_crowdfunding">equity crowdfunding</a> platforms. Investments are usually made with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_strategy"> investment strategy</a> in mind. <img src="bull.avif" alt="bul stock" height="700" width="1550"></P>
  <u><h1>Size of the market</h1></u>
  <p>The total <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization">market capitalization</a> of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rose from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"> US$</a>2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.</p>
  <p id="exchange">As of 2016, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization">market capitalization</a> of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_marketing">global market</a> capitalization. Apart from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange">Australian Securities Exchange,</a> these 16 exchanges are all in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America, Europe,</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia">Asia.</a></p>
  <p>By country, the largest stock markets as of January 2022 are in the United States of America (about 59.9%), followed by Japan (about 6.2%) and United Kingdom (about 3.9%).</p>

  <p><b>Main article:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange">Stock exchange</a></p>
  <FOoter ><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange">stock exchange</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_(organized_market)">exchange</a> (or bourse) where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockbroker">stockbrokers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_trader"> traders</a> can buy and sell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance)">shares</a> (equity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock">stock</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)">bonds,</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)">securities.</a> Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue">large companies</a> have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)"> "over the counter"</a> (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.</p>
    <p>Stock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed-interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives, which are more likely to be traded OTC.</p>
    <p>Trade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">Equities</a> (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.</p>
    <p>Participants in the stock market range from small individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_trader">stock investors</a> to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"> banks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance">insurance</a> companies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_fund">pension funds</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund">hedge funds</a>. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)">trader</a>.
    <center><img src="stock.jpg" alt="stock" width="1500"></p></FOoter>
    <p>Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_outcry">open outcry</a>. This method is used in some stock exchanges and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commodities_exchanges">commodities exchanges</a>, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq">NASDAQ</a>.</p>
